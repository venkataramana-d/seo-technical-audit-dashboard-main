"""Crawl comparison / diff engine — 02-AUDIT-ENGINE.md §6, the foundation for
Phase 3 "Always-on" scheduled auditing (00-PLAN-OVERVIEW.md Phase 3).

Compares two crawls of the same project and reports which issues are new, fixed,
or still-present since last time, plus the Health/SEO score trend. Same logic
whether triggered manually (Compare UI) or by a cron schedule.

Pure module: `diff_issue_records` / `evaluate_alert_rules` work on plain records
and never touch the DB. The DB-facing `compare_crawls` (loads Issue rows, maps
them onto records, calls the pure functions) lives in crawler/diff_runner.py so
this stays importable without a database.
