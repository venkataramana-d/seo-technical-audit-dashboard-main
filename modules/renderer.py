"""Playwright-based rendering: a drop-in peer of `fetch_page()`
(modules/auditor.py), used when a crawl has `render_js` enabled
(01-CRAWLER-ENGINE.md §3). Returns the exact same dict shape so it plugs
into `audit_url(prefetched=...)` unchanged — the whole per-page audit
pipeline doesn't need to know whether its input came from `requests` or a
real browser.

No SSRF self-validation here, matching `fetch_page()`'s own precedent:
validation happens once at the seed/sitemap level (`validate_audit_url()`
in modules/auditor.py), and individual page URLs reaching this function are
already domain-scoped by the crawler's `_in_scope()` check before being
queued — a peer fetch function doesn't re-validate per call.

Each call is fully self-contained (its own browser launch/close) rather
than reusing one instance across a thread — Playwright's sync API ties a
browser to the OS thread that created it, and safely sharing one across
calls needs real lifecycle bookkeeping this phase's scope doesn't need.
Slower per page (~200-500ms relaunch overhead), but trivially safe to
reason about — rendering is already expected to be far slower than a raw
fetch (see modules/crawler.py's dedicated, small render-worker pool).
