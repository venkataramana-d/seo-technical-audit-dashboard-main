"""Encryption primitives for the API-key vault (Phase 5,
05-INFRASTRUCTURE-AND-OPS.md §4: "encrypt provider secrets at rest").

Uses Fernet (AES-128-CBC + HMAC, from the already-installed `cryptography`
package) rather than hand-rolled crypto. The doc's own suggestion — "AES-256-
GCM with a KMS-managed key" — assumes a KMS this local-dev setup doesn't
have (the same class of gap as Postgres/Redis being stood in for locally);
Fernet keyed by an env var is the same tier of tradeoff, using a real,
audited implementation rather than approximating one.

`VAULT_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is read at call time, not import time, so modules
that import this file but never actually touch the vault aren't broken by
it being unset. There is deliberately no fallback: a missing key must fail
loudly, never silently store plaintext or encrypt under a throwaway
key that would make existing rows undecryptable after a restart.
