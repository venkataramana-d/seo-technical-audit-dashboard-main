"""`python -m worker` — starts the worker loop.

Imports `worker.tasks` for its side effect (registering job handlers via the
`@register` decorator) before starting. The loop itself interleaves two
things in one process (no separate scheduler process/cron daemon — see
`worker/scheduler.py`'s docstring for why): claiming/processing queued jobs
via `Worker.run_once()`, and periodically checking for due recurring crawls
via `enqueue_due_crawls()`. `worker/queue.py` stays fully generic — only this
driving loop knows both concerns exist.
