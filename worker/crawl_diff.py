"""Phase 3 diff engine (02-AUDIT-ENGINE.md §6) — comparing crawl N vs. N-1 of
the same project. Computed on demand from existing Page/Issue rows, not
persisted (same "recompute, don't materialize" choice as
worker/site_audit.py's get_thematic_report).

Matching is by URL, not row ID: each crawl creates entirely fresh Page rows
(Phase 1 design), so page_id isn't stable across crawls of the same project.
Page-level issues are matched by (Page.url, Issue.issue_type); sitewide
issues (page_id IS NULL) are matched by issue_type alone — coarser, since an
aggregate finding's exact member list isn't tracked as an identity.
