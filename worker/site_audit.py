"""Post-crawl aggregation pass (02-AUDIT-ENGINE.md §2/§5) — checks that only
make sense once a whole crawl exists to compare across pages: duplicate
titles/descriptions/H1s/content, orphan pages, sitewide redirect chains/
loops, broken internal links, and hreflang reciprocity. Runs once, called
from `crawl_service.finalize_crawl()` right before a crawl is marked
completed.

Each finding becomes an `Issue` row. Aggregate findings that describe a
*group* of pages (duplicates, orphans, sitemap diff) get `page_id=None`
(confirmed nullable in Phase 0 for exactly this); findings that are
genuinely about one specific page (a long redirect chain, a broken link's
source page, a missing hreflang reciprocal) get that page's `page_id` set,
so they also surface in that page's own issue list.

`category` values below are deliberately chosen to match substrings already
in `modules.scoring.THEMES` (e.g. "Redirects", "Internal Links") so these new
sitewide issues sort into the right thematic tab via the existing
`get_thematic_issues()` — no new categorization logic to maintain.
