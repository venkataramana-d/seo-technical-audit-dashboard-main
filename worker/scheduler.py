"""Phase 3 "Always-on" scheduling — a tick function, not a daemon. There's no
Redis/cloud infra here (still a single local worker process, per Phase 0's
scope), so recurring crawls work by having the worker's own loop
periodically call `enqueue_due_crawls()` (wired in `worker/__main__.py`)
rather than relying on OS-level cron or a distributed scheduler.

No separate `schedules` table: `CrawlConfig.schedule_cron`/`next_run_at`
(Phase 0 + this phase) already carry everything needed — a `schedules` table
per `03-DATA-MODEL-AND-API.md` would just duplicate `crawl_config_id` +
`cron_expr`.
